# Data Visualization Engineer

## Data Visualization Engineering Skills

* Technical + Design Expertise

* solid understanding of UI development

* principles of design \(graphic principles and user-centered design\)

1. Technical - **hack data visualization methods and reproduce any charing methdos you see**
2. Theoretical - **understand the fundamental principles of visual display of information**
3. Practically - **think of yourself as a designer first **\(finding out what your readers first, touches on interaction design, information design, and graphic design\)


Comparing a data viz role to an analyst role:

* an Analyst role focus is on the question

* a Data Viz role focus is on an audience that typically needs something more than a single report and expects views into the data that generate more than the expected insights

### 3 concerns:

1. Data visualization products are extremely conservative

2. Data visualization as a professioanl focus currently lacks clear avenues for advancement, so bright people with ambition feel forced to transition into other science or engineering roles in order to advance

3. Data visualization is underrepresented in leadership positions
