# D3

## What is D3

* Data-Driven Documents \(name is a clever allusion of W3\)
* Documents are web-based documents 

## What it does

* Loading data into the browser's memory
* Binding data to elements within the document, creating new elements as needed
* Transforming those elements by interpreting each element's bound datum and setting its visual properties accordingly.
* Transitioning elements between states in response to user input.


## What we're working with

1. DOM \(Document Object Model\)
2. Html \(Hypertext Markup Language\) particularly the SVG element
3. CSS \(Cascading Style Sheets\)
4. JS \(Javascript\)

### How do these relate with each other?

* The Document Object Model \(DOM\) is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document \(Wikipedia def\). Through a process called **rendering**, the browser is able to display a webpage by parsing HTML, applying visual rules listed in the CSS, and generating DOM.
