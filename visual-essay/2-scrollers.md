# Scrollytelling

## 6 Javascript libraries

1. Waypoints
2. ScrollStory
3. Scrollmagic
4. Graph-scroll
5. In-view
6. Scrollama
7. Create your own

## Some Recommendations by Russell Goldenberg

- For highly customized stories you will want ScrollMagic or Waypoints.

- For the beginner you might want to check out ScrollStory, especially if you lean on jQuery.

- For the d3 lover you should explore graph-scroll.js, but be ready to accept the defaults or be ready to tinker.
